To-dos:
1. Improve Nopmo
  - Optimize CSS for firefox (done) and mobile (done)
  - Add a relapse log (for ongoing and past streaks) section (Mood, Confidence, Motivational, Cognition,Productivity, Journal)
    -Its own component/section (linked from reset and sidebar)
    Setup
      -'P/M' (orange and red dot) are entries in the log - with option for user to write-up
      -'O' (black) ends the current log and puts it into 'past logs' section (option to write-up as well)
      -Upon reset, first entry will be a compilation of the previous streak's P/M/O resets and write-ups
      -Journal section
        -User can select what day to input journal entry
        -Mood: Emojis? Terrible, bad, neutral, content, happy, frustrated
        -Productivity: Bad, normal, good
        -Confidence: Low, normal, high
        -Cogntion: Brainfog, normal, Clear
        -Motivation:
        -Write-up(optional)
        -Page navigator
  - Reroute to home upon submitting reset, once streak component done, reroute to streak

2. career
  -Add Nopmo into portfolio website [done but just replacing robofriends] (Implement JS to switch project panel (in react it would simply be a routing/display of components but for traditional web setup how?))
  -Do up new resume [done]
  -Send applications [doing]
  -Portfolio webiste -> change fapper rank to hobo and include pokemon picture in pokedex screenshot


3. CS
  -SICP book, write notes in notebook



7/3/20 (5.5 hours of productivity time)

-1.5 hours for CSS optimization
-2 hours for portfolio website, resume
-2 hours for SICP (at night)

9/3/20 (6 hours of productivity)

-1.5 hour for CSS optimization(mobile) and change rank name/screenshot on portfolio?
  -Problems
    1. Sidebar button is behind component(unclickable), even if clickable sidebar will block
      -Solution: if @ media (max width 700px)
        -INACTIVE: width 100vh, height 100px, margin top -100px, (toggle button change to menu logo, flushed to right margin bottom -100px)
        -ACTIVE: width 100vh, height 100px, margin top 0px, (toggle button margin bottom: auto/0)

    2. Overlapping components
      -Solution: if @ media (max width 700px)
        -Change component positions to be static
        -Change rank/Emergency/reset/reddit buttons to inline-flex
-2.5 hours for resume crafting and cover letter

NOPMO streak component

1. Current streak component
  -Fixed "Started" entry with green dot
  -Reset log component (P/M/O)
    -onclick of submit button on reset component,
      -if p checked generate log with orange dot
      -if m checked generate log with red dot
      -if o checked, generate log with black dot, save all relevant info from current streak into STREAKS table and re-render current streak with only fixed entry
  -Journal log component
  -Since both types of logs are on same chronology, have 1 resetlogsArray component inside currentstreak
    -pass down array of reset information as props
      -array of reset information must be comprehensive list of all resets during current streak
        -accomplish inside reset counter action, by creating a resetlog reducer/state (e.g. if p.checked dispatch type,writeup,date) PROBLEM: states function by replacing, not incrementing.. SOLUTION: add another state 'resetlog' in initialuserstate,
        spread operator return [...state, newObj]
        OR
        -accomplish by creating an array on App level, pushing {type,writeup,date} object into array when reset counter action called PROBLEM: isn't this just a pseudo-state?
      -e.g. [{type:p, writeup: 'i fked up', date: x/x/x}, {type:p, writeup: 'i fked up', date: x/x/x}]
    -map reset info array to logs Array, passing down data as props (e.g. write-up, color, date)
      -function in map, return (reset log component IF log.color) return (journal log component IF log.motivation)
    -WIPE STATE UPON O AFTER 1)UPDATING STATE AND 2)GENERATING RESET LOG COMPONENT 3)SAVING INFORMATION INTO DATABASE AS ONE ROW

2. Past streaks component
  -rows in STREAK table should have been saved from previous current STREAKS
  -fetch entries in database, put into paststreakdata
  -Render paststreaks array component
    -map paststreakdata to const paststreaks array
      -return past streak component

3. Journal component
  -Most items within are fixed, just follow layout
  -create action for submit Journal
    -Put in userstate reducer as well, add to the array of objects 'resetlog'
  -submit button onclick will run action


4. Database
  -STREAKS table
  -username varchar(100) unique not null primary key
  -id serial (increment based on each username) notnull
  -Date started string not null
  -Date ended string not null
  -Days Interval not null
  -resetlog
    -store as column?
    OR
    -store as two other resetlog/journallog tables
      -resetlog table [username(foreignkey), streakid(how to link), color,date,writeup]
      -journallog table [username(foreignkey), streakid(how to link), date, day, mood, productivity, confidence, cognition, motivation, writeup]

4.5 hours of NOPMO streak component

  Create journal component, mood/confidence/productivity/motivation/cognition selectors, write-up input field, date selector (react-flatpickr) [ACTUALLY DO WITHOUT DATEPICKER FIRST, JUST SHOW CURRENT DATE, APPEND INTO LOGS ARRAY CHRONOLOGICALLY]
  -onclick of submit, append data into logs array

  plan out schema of databases and how O is going to save data into them and clear state.

1.5 hours SICP at home

Nopmo
-Problem with proposed setup (within current streak, reset and joural actions with send to state, O will save state data to database and clear state):
  -state gets cleared after every session..... data is not persistent

SOLUTION: every action will fetch database, append into the respective tables and put in state(if necessary)

2 tables
  -#1 STREAK
  streakid (pkey)
  username
  streak number (for each user)
  day started
  day ended
  days?

  -#2 LOGS (split RESETLOGS AND JOURNAL LOGS INTO 2 TABLES OR KEEP AS 1 TABLE AND HAVE NULL COLUMNS)
  streakid (fkey)
  log number (counter to track chronology of logs in each streak?)
  type: reset/journal
  date (string)
    -columns for resetlog
      color
      writeup
    -columns for journallog
      Mood
      Confidence
      Cognition
      Motivation
      productivity
      writeup


----SETUP---

REGISTER ACTIONS add-on
-Upon register, will create streak entry, day ended and days is left empty (dispatch streakid to loaduserstate)


RESETCARD ACTIONS
  -Upon submission of O
    -initialize new entry in logs table
      -streakid (currentstreakid in load userstate)
      -type: reset
      -typeOfRelapse: o
      -color: black
      -Date: new Date()
    -input into STREAKS table day ended and days data (select field through username & latest field? OR select field by having a counter in the users table (curent streak id)) [TO END THE CURENT STREAK] (TRY: currentstreakID in loadUserState)
    -initialize new entry in streaks table
    -modify currentstreakID in USERS table and subsequently loadUserState (should already be done by submitreset action)
  -Upon submission of P
    -initialize new entry in logs table
      -streakid (currentstreakid in load userstate)
      -type: reset
      -typeOfRelapse: p
      -color: orange
      -Date: new Date()
-  -Upon submission of M
    -initialize new entry in logs table
      -streakid (currentstreakid in load userstate)
      -type: reset
      -typeOfRelapse: m
      -color: red
      -Date: new Date()

JOURNAl ACTIONS
  -Upon submission of journal
    -initialize new entry in logs table
      -streakid (currentstreakid in load userstate)
      -type: journal
      -Mood: req.body.___
      -Confidence: req.body.___
